# Rotiro Express/Typescript Demo

This demo creates a very simple 'faked' api which demonstrates how to define basic GET, POST, PUT requests etc.

## Getting Started

Cone the repo and run 
```bash
yarn install
```

followed by

```bash
yarn start
```

## Using the demo

The api will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with the following endpoints defined
* [http://localhost:3000/ping](http://localhost:3000/ping) [GET]
* [http://localhost:3000/users](http://localhost:3000/users) [GET, POST]
* [http://localhost:3000/users/1](http://localhost:3000/users/1) [GET, PUT]

> POST and PUT actions will need be tested using an app like Postman
